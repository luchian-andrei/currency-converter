# About

Currency converter where you can choose between some of the most used currency in the market.
Calls an external API to get the actual exchange rates.

##

Set some alert to make sure all the required input fields are completed so the API call will be succesfull.

I used toastify for alert, tailwind for styling and the rest of the components are made by me.
You can also change the language of the app.
